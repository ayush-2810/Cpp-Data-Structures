# Cpp-Data-Structures
This repository contains **data structures** implemented  in **c++**.

- **Linked List** : A linked list is a **linear data structure**, in which the elements are **not stored at contiguous memory locations**.  
The elements in a linked list are **linked** using **pointers**.  
In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each **node** contains a data field and a **reference(link)** to the next node in the list.  
  - **Linked_list_insert** : This file contains the implementation of linked list and printing the linked list also.  
  
  - **ith_node** : This file contains a function which prints the ith node of the linked list.  
  
  - **deleting_ith_node** : This file contains a function which deletes the ith node of the linked list.  
  
  - **palindrome_check** : This file contains a function which checks whether the linked list is palindrome or not.  
  
  - **Duplicate_elimination** : This file contains a function which removes/eliminate duplicates from the linked list.

- Graphs : A Graph is a **non-linear** data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph can be defined as,  
A Graph consists of a finite set of **vertices(or nodes)** and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.  
Graphs are used to solve many **real-life problems**. Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network. Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook. For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node). Each node is a structure and contains information like person id, name, gender, locale etc.

   - **BFS** : This file contains the bfs traversal of the graph.BFS is level wise printing of the vertices.

  - **DFS** : This file contains the dfs traversal of the graph.DFS is depth wise printing of the vertices.
