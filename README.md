# Cpp-Data-Structures
This repository contains **data structures** implemented  in **c++**.

- **Linked List** : A linked list is a **linear data structure**, in which the elements are **not stored at contiguous memory locations**.  
The elements in a linked list are linked using **pointers**.  
In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.  
  - **Linked_list_insert** : This file contains the implementation of linked list and printing the linked list also.  
  
  - **ith_node** : This file contains a function which prints the ith node of the linked list.  
  
  - **deleting_ith_node** : This file contains a function which deletes the ith node of the linked list.
